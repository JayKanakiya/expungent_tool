      <div class="panel">
        <p>The answer to this question is a difficult one. There are many factors that determine
        if your record is expungeable. This difficulty is why we created this tool. By using this app,
        you will be able to get to the bottom of whether or not your case is expungeable.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why is Expungment Important?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Expungement gives you a clean slate. Having criminal charges on your record can prevent
        you from finding employment, public housing, and other government services. Expunging your
        criminal record can make accessing work, housing, and services easier.
        Generally, it provides a stronger level of protection and in some cases is as if the record never existed.
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">What are Expungement Tools?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Expungement Tools can break down the process into more user-friendly chunks,
          telling visitors, for example, how to get a copy of their actual criminal records.
          They can provide a series of simply worded questions to help users discover whether
          charges filed against them are potentially expungeable, including queries about how
          old they were when charged, where the criminal case occurred and whether the individual
          was released without conviction. In addition, users are potentially able to download
          expungement petitions and fee waivers directly from the website.
          An example of one of these tools is ExpungeMaryland.org. The Expunge Maryland tool is
          user facing meaning the individual seeking to have their record expunged is who the tool
          is designed for. The individual will answer a series of questions surrounding their
          circumstances and then based on the answers a recommendation will be whether or not
          the individual’s record is eligible for expungement along with next possible steps.</p>

      <button class="accordion">What is Record Sealing?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Record sealing is the legal process of concealing or hiding charges
          from a person’s permanent criminal record so that it is not accessible
          by the public, though it might still be available to law enforcement and
          certain prospective employers. Once a person’s records are sealed, all
          of the proceedings recounted in a person’s record are treated as if
          they never occurred.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Is it easy to get my record expunged?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Getting a criminal record sealed or expunged is not easy in any state.
          Most people have no idea which charges can be expunged or how the process works.
          While the Internet is chock-full of information, it's often of little help to most
          because the information is difficult to decipher and involves lengthy explanations of a
          complicated state statute. Information can be found using “Expungement Tools” which
          are web-based interactive apps providing general
          information and access to state specific links, or attorney websites.

          As for juvenile records, they can be expunged once the juvenile reaches the majority age.
